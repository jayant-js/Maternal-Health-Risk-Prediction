# Maternal Health Risk Analysis

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project analyzes maternal health risk levels using machine learning classification techniques. The dataset contains 1013 instances with 7 key features related to maternal health. The goal is to classify risk levels into three categories: **low, mid, and high**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:  
[Maternal Health Risk Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk)

### Features:
1. **Age** - Age of the patient
2. **SystolicBP** - Systolic blood pressure
3. **DiastolicBP** - Diastolic blood pressure
4. **BS (Blood Sugar)** - Blood glucose level
5. **BodyTemp** - Body temperature
6. **HeartRate** - Heart rate of the patient
7. **RiskLevel** - Target variable (Low, Mid, High)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Structure
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Data distribution, feature analysis, and insights.
- **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, outlier removal, and feature scaling.
- **Model Training** - Applying machine learning models for classification.
- **Evaluation & Visualization** - Confusion matrix, accuracy metrics, and final model insights.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- LaTeX for report generation
- Overleaf for document formatting

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
- Different classification models were tested for accuracy.
- Key features influencing maternal health risks were analyzed.
- The final model provides a reliable prediction of maternal risk levels.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
